To achieve maximum accuracy,I changed various parameters like pool_filters,filters,strides,convolutional layers.(3,3) for pool filters was the optimal value.I changed the strides to 0,2 to no avail.I added hidden more hidden layes but the accuracy was not so good.I employed regularization and varied the ratio;there i found that the as the weights of the layers decreased ,the ratio should be decreased too.I tried the sigmoid function but the accuracy wasnt good.I also varied the input for hidden layers and found the optimal value for maximum efficiency. I also observed that retraining on the same model,I wasnt getting same efficiency and it was decreasing .
